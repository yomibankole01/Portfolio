## [Examining the Effect of Environmental Factors and Weather on Bike Rentals](https://github.com/yomibankole01/Seoul_BikeSharingDemand_Prediction)

<img src="images/seoul.png?raw=true"/>

- **Skills Used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn
  
- **Project Objective:** Predicting bike rental demand based on weather and seasonal factors to proactively manage resources and enhance bike utilization.
  
- **Quantifiable Result:** Achieved a prediction accuracy of over 70%.

### Key Steps:

1. Applied Linear Regression to forecast the number of bikes rented in Seoul.
2. Processed categorical variables by encoding them using Sklearn.
3. Achieved high prediction accuracy through iterative improvements in the multiple linear regression model.

## [Implementing Deep Neutral Network with Keras MNIST Handwritten Digits recognition](https://github.com/yomibankole01/MNIST_Handwriting_Recognition_CNN)

 <img src="images/mnist.png?raw=true"/>

- **Skills Used:** Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Sklearn, Python, Neural Networking, Keras, Tensorflow
- **Project Objective:** Implementation of a Deep Neural Network with Keras for recognizing handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.
- **Quantifiable Results:**
  - Loss: 0.1261 - Accuracy: 0.9656

### Project Workflow:

1. Loaded and explored the data.
2. Conducted initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Prepared and preprocessed the data.
4. Constructed the neural network model.
5. Evaluated the model's performance.
6. Enhanced the model by adjusting its depth.
